tutor: Interactive tutorials for R
----------------------------------

The **tutor** package makes it easy to turn any [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document into an interactive tutorial. Tutorials consist of content along with interactive components for checking and reinforcing understanding. Tutorials can include any or all of the following:

1.  Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations.

2.  Videos (supported services include YouTube and Vimeo).

3.  Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly).

4.  Quiz questions.

5.  Interactive Shiny applets.

You can find documentation on using the **tutor** package here: <https://rstudio.github.com/tutor/>
